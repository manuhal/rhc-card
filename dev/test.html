Q: what's the typical folder structure for a web project?
A: A typical folder structure for a web project might look like this:   
- index.html (main HTML file)
- css/ (folder for CSS files)
  - styles.css (main CSS file)  
- js/ (folder for JavaScript files)
  - script.js (main JavaScript file)        
- images/ (folder for images)
  - logo.png (example image)        
- fonts/ (folder for custom fonts)
  - custom-font.ttf (example font)  
- components/ (folder for reusable components)
  - header.html (example component)     
- README.md (project documentation)
- package.json (if using npm for dependencies)      
Q: should I group css, js into a folder called assets?
A: Grouping CSS and JavaScript files into a folder called "assets" is a common practice in web development. It helps to keep the project organized by separating different types of files. For example, you could have an "assets" folder with subfolders for "css" and "js":
- assets/
  - css/
    - styles.css
  - js/
    - script.js
Q: and images too into assets?
A: Yes, you can also include an "images" folder within the "assets" directory to keep all your static files organized. The structure would look like this:
- assets/
  - css/
    - styles.css
  - js/
    - script.js
  - images/
    - logo.png

Q: your recommedation?
A: My recommendation is to use a clear and organized folder structure that suits the needs of your project. Grouping related files together can make it easier to manage and maintain your code. For example, using an "assets" folder with subfolders for "css", "js", and "images" can help keep your project tidy and make it easier to find specific files when needed. Ultimately, the best structure depends on the size and complexity of your project, as well as your personal preferences.    
Q: separate css, js, images folder or group into assets, both are common, right?
A: Yes, both approaches are common and widely used in web development. Some developers prefer to keep CSS, JavaScript, and images in separate folders at the root level of the project for simplicity. Others prefer to group them into an "assets" folder to further organize their files. The choice between these two structures often comes down to personal preference and the specific needs of the project. Both methods are valid and can be effective for managing your web project's files.       
Q: i think i'll separate it, so shorter URL path, right?
A: Yes, separating CSS, JavaScript, and images into their own folders at the root level can result in shorter URL paths when referencing these files in your HTML. For example, if you have a CSS file in a "css" folder, you would reference it as "css/styles.css" instead of "assets/css/styles.css". This can make your code cleaner and easier to read. However, the difference in URL length is minimal, so it's more important to choose a structure that you find intuitive and easy to manage.
